# Predictive Housing Price Modeling with Neural Networks
This is a project focused on predictive modeling of housing prices using neural networks. The project explores different network architectures and training parameters. In addition, it evaluates the model's performance using both non-cross-validated and cross-validated approaches.

# How to Execute the Code in Jupyter Notebook
To execute the code in a Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

- Install the Required Libraries: Install the necessary libraries from the requirements.txt file.
```bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Open Jupyter Notebook: Launch Jupyter Notebook in the project folder.

- Execute Cells in Jupyter Notebook: Open the Asgn3_21CS10052.ipynb Jupyter Notebook and run each cell one after the other.

Review the Output: The Jupyter Notebook will display the output, including performance metrics and results for the different neural network configurations.

For more detailed information and code explanations, you can refer to the ```report.pdf``` file.
